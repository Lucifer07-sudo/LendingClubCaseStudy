## General Information
- Lending Club stands as the most extensive peer-to-peer platform linking borrowers and lenders. Prospective borrowers submit their applications via an online portal, where an internal rating is designated to them. Lenders then make two pivotal decisions: 1) whether to extend a loan, and 2) the specifics of the loan arrangement, including elements like the interest rate, monthly payments, and loan duration.
